/*
package namecoin is an extension of x/cash from weave,
allowing more information for wallets and tokens.

Token tickers (currency code) must be registered before they can
be used, and are associated with a human readable name, as well
as a flexible number of significant figures.

Wallets also have a name associated with them, which must be unique
and can be used to locate the wallet (secondary index).
